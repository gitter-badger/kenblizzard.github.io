                <p>The best way to learn web development is by building something that interests you. As you develop coding skills, you will understand what is possible and that will inspire you to create your own project. By applying your skills on an interesting project, you will enjoy the learning process more and learn at a faster pace. So start working on your own project as soon as possible while continuing to gain more skills by following this roadmap.

				<p>Learning how to code is similar to learning a new language. The best language students don't just take courses, they also immerse themselves in the new culture by spending a lot of time with native speakers.

					The big focus this time around is on large, all-in-one computers. The company has two gaming-focused all-in-one devices â€“ the Gaming 24GE and the AG270 2QC 3K (whew, that's a mouthful). Aside from its 4K monitor, the former features the "latest" Intel Core i7 processor, although we're not sure if that means it's a Haswell or Broadwell CPU. For graphics, it uses Nvidia's GeForce GTX 960M GPU. Its little brother, the AG270 2QC 3K, also features an Intel Core i7 processor, but as its name suggests, it only has a 2560 x 1440 resolution.

					However, it has a slightly more powerful GPU than the Gaming 24GE in the form of a GTX 970M. Both computers also feature a new audio technology called Nahimic Audio Technology, which promises to deliver virtual surround sound, bass boost, and the ability to change sound levels. When using headphones, the audio system also provides noise cancelling and a voice leveler.
