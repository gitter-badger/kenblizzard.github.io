                <p>The best way to learn web development is by building something that interests you. As you develop coding skills, you will understand what is possible and that will inspire you to create your own project. By applying your skills on an interesting project, you will enjoy the learning process more and learn at a faster pace. So start working on your own project as soon as possible while continuing to gain more skills by following this roadmap.

				<p>Learning how to code is similar to learning a new language. The best language students don't just take courses, they also immerse themselves in the new culture by spending a lot of time with native speakers.
